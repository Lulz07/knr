My solutions for K&R book exercises
===================================
Some of the solutions I provided here might contain bugs, logical errors or
grammatical mistakes inside comments (I'm not a native English speaker).
Feel free to submit pull requests if you encounter any of these.

Style guide used
================
- Linux kernel coding style (but with 4 spaces for indentation and the maximum
  limit on the length of lines is only 65 columns, so that the source code is
  displayed nicely on mobile view (this does not applied to README file
  anyway)).
  Coding style documentation:
  - https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html#

Repository status
